## Main Commitment
### *I will code for at least two hours every day for the next 300 days.*

#### Start Date

## General Rules
1. I will tweet about my progress every day -> using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode.
2. If I code at work, that time won't count towards the challenge.
3. I will update the [Log](log.md) with the day's progress.
4. I will work on real projects, facing real challenges.
5. I will always push myself to learn something new.
